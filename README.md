# FSMDesign

In this project, the utilization of BRAM (Block RAM), AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) controllers, and a Finite State Machine (FSM) formed the cornerstone of executing encoded tasks seamlessly via the Vivado command line interface. BRAM served as a crucial memory element, facilitating the storage and retrieval of essential data required for task execution. Leveraging the flexibility and robustness of AXI controllers, I orchestrated the communication between different modules within the design, ensuring efficient data flow and synchronization. The FSM, meticulously designed and implemented, orchestrated the sequential execution of tasks, thereby optimizing the overall performance and reliability of the system.

A significant aspect of this project involved the meticulous management of input data. Through a series of meticulously crafted commands and Vivado TCL commands, I meticulously loaded and manipulated information within the BRAM, ensuring its availability and integrity throughout the execution cycle. Moreover, the design intricately integrated multiple GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) blocks, serving as the interface between the external environment and the internal processing units. Notably, these GPIO blocks were instrumental in handling various input and output operations, including managing ADD and MULTIPLY offsets and facilitating the storage of computed results in dedicated output registers.

One of the key challenges encountered during the project revolved around addressing the disparate clock frequencies within the system. With the FSM operating at a clock frequency of 75MHz and the remainder of the system running at 100MHz, I meticulously navigated the intricacies of managing separate clock domains. Employing advanced synchronization techniques and clock domain crossing methodologies, I ensured seamless communication and coordination between different modules, mitigating potential timing violations and ensuring the robustness and reliability of the system as a whole.

Overall, this project not only showcased my proficiency in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) design and implementation but also underscored my ability to navigate complex design constraints and challenges effectively. By leveraging a combination of innovative design techniques, meticulous planning, and rigorous testing methodologies, I successfully delivered a high-performance, reliable, and scalable solution capable of executing encoded tasks with precision and efficiency.
